# Student Survey Analysis

> There are many stores in which a survey was conducted based on students i.e. how much they are spending on different kind of purchases like Video games, Indoor games, Toys, Books, Gadgets etc. In the data set (Student Survey), Store setting is the column that explains the Type of location in which the store is present. A Power BI report has been created using data set (Student Survey), to extract the meaningful Insights. 

1.	A tabular visualisation has been created on the total amount of purchase (TAP) based on ‘Store location’ and ‘Store setting’. 
2.	Matrix Visualization has been created to show the amount spent on Outdoor sports across different ages and ‘Store setting’. 
3.	Funnel chart has been created to show Total amount of purchase by ‘Store setting’.
4.	Pie Chart has been created to show the total amount of purchase by different ‘Store location’ for Suburban ‘Store setting’ only.
5.	Scatter Plot has been created to show Video games purchase and Outdoor sports spent across the different ages.
